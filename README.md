# msusel-qatch

**This project is currently at an alpha stage work-in-progress.**

This academic project is an extension of the quality analysis framework found at GitHub https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/qatch and website http://83.212.105.167:8080/OnlineProjectEvaluator/

## Overview
This fork intends to extend Qatch by adding C# and TypeScript functionality, quality of life changes and refactoring, better external tool support, and will utilize the framework to run context-aware secutiy quality analysis. 

Academically, the framework will be used to evaluate the following questions:
  - Can complex, deep-layered Quamoco quality models be effectively reduced to the 3-layer, fully-connected model used in Qatch?
  - Can static analysis effectively assist domain-aware quality analysis of security?
